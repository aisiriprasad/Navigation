This SwiftUI project allowed me to explore and understand how to implement NavigationStack for managing multi-screen navigation in iOS apps. I practiced creating smooth transitions between views using NavigationLink and learned how to pass data between screens effectively. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience setting up navigation containers, customizing navigation titles, and structuring an app for seamless user flow. This foundational knowledge of navigation stacks in SwiftUI equips me to build more complex, layered interfaces in future app development projects.
